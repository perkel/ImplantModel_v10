Getting started with this cochlear implant model

1.	Download and install PyCharm Community Edition.
2.	Create a new Project
3.	Add python packages to the Project: numpy, scipy, lmfit, shapely, matplotlib, lmfit, Minimizer
4.	Place relevant ImplantModel files in the Project or pull the repository from github
5.	Add a run configuration to the Project to run voltage_calc.py. This script precalculates the table of voltages and
    activation functions used by the rest of the model.
6.	Edit voltage_calc.py. Main parameters to review/edit: radius, res_int, res_ext, zEval, output_filename and
    resolution. Running this will probably take overnight, depending on the machine.
7.	Alternatively, use the file provided as a voltage table.
8.	Run the forward model. First, add a run configuration to the Project to run FwdModel4.py.
    Then edit common_params.py to set the specific scenario(s) to run. Output from the forward model will be placed
    into a folder called FWD_OUTPUT
9.	Before running the inverse model it's critical to run the 2D forward model. This surveys the parameter space to
    help facilitate initial conditions for the inverse model.
    Add a run configuration to the Project to run FwdModel4_2D.py. Then run it.
10.	The inverse model can be run in either of two modes: using a known scenario of electrode position and
    neuronal density or based on a subject's measured thresholds. This choice is made on line 39 of
    InverseModelCombined. Set the variable "use_fwd_model" to True to use a known scenario or to False to use subject
    data. Set the variable SCENARIOS in common_params to indicate which scenario(s) or subject(s) you wish to study.
11. Run the inverse model. Add a run configuration to the Project to run InverseModelCombined.py.
    While it is running you will see the average threshold error in dB scroll in the console.
12. Output can be found in the INV_OUTPUT directory
