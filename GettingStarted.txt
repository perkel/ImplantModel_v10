Getting started with this cochlear implant model

1.	Download and install PyCharm Community Edition.
2.	Create a new Project
3.	Add python packages to the Project: numpy, scipy, lmfit, shapely, matplotlib
4.	Place relevant ImplantModel files in the Project or pull the repository from github
5.	Add a run configuration to the Project to run voltage_calc.py. This script precalculates the table of voltages and
    activation functions used by the rest of the model.
6.	Edit voltage_calc.py. Main parameters to review/edit: radius, res_int, res_ext, zEval, output_filename and
    resolution. Running this will probably take overnight, depending on the machine.
7.	Alternatively, use the file provided as a voltage table.
8.	Run the forward model. First, add a run configuration to the Project to run FwdModel4.py.
    Then edit common_params.py to set the specific scenario(s) to run. Output from the forward model will be placed
    into a folder called FWD_OUTPUT
9.	Before running the inverse model it's critical to run the 2D forward model.
    Add a run configuration to the Project to run FwdModel4_2D.py. Then run it.
10.	The inverse model can be run in either of two modes: using a known scenario of electrode position and
    neuronal density or based on a subject's measured thresholds. This choice is made.Run the inverse model. Add a run configuration to the Project to run InverseModelCombined_SE.py. Run the file. While it is running you will see the average threshold error in dB scroll in the console.
